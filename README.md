CODE REVIEW ANALYTICS
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD FROM THE PROBLEM?
Code reviews help in keeping the software very clean. But when it comes to humans – they review differently.
Some focus on making it readable, others on the security and some just rush through without seeing much.
All these can cause inconsistencies.
Example- There is a startup company, and they have to submit a solution before a deadline. A developer (Ram) submits the solution for review, while another developer (Shyam) does not optimize the code and quickly submits it without proper checks. As a result, many bugs are later found in the code, causing delays and frustration.
Here, we could use an AI tool that tracks the quality of the code, highlights rushed approvals, and provides detailed feedback on improvements to avoid such issues.
WHO WILL USE THESE TOOLS?
1)
Mainly developers - understand how good is the quality of their code.
2)
managers – can track how well the feedbacks are.
3)
Testers - Ensure that the reviewed code meets quality standards before release.
HOW WILL THEY USE IT ?
1)
Firstly a tool which checks – 1)the code quality , readability
2)
how long the review takes for one code .
2) AI -Review tool which will give response like – 1) feedback.
2) optimize the code.
WHAT BENEFITS DO THE USER GET?
1)
Optimized Resource Utilization – By ensuring code is reviewed properly the first time, teams spend less time fixing mistakes later, allowing them to focus on new features and improvements.
2)
Developers – get AI feedback to help them improve their skills on reviewing.
3)
Managers- they can set a benchmark for review quality.
4)
Customer Satisfaction – Higher code quality leads to fewer bugs in production, meaning users get a smoother and more reliable experience.
5)
Cost Reduction – A well-reviewed code that works the first time reduces the need for rework, saving time and development costs.
Example- If a developer never checks documentation, but if the AI always mentions it, the developer will start paying attention and can also learn from the feedback. How Do We Check Code Quality?
There are two main ways to check if a piece of code is good:
1.
Using Automated Tools & Tests – These tools scan the code and give feedback without a human needing to read through it. They check for:
1)Efficiency – Does the code run fast and use resources wisely?
2)Bug-Free – Are there errors or security issues that need fixing?
2.
Human Code Reviews – Some things can’t be fully checked by a tool. A human needs to read and understand the code’s logic. AI can help make this easier by pointing out areas that might need improvement. Human reviewers focus on:
1)
Readability – Is the code clear and easy to understand?
2)
Maintainability – Will it be easy to update or modify in the future?
How AI Can Help with Code Reviews
Since automated tools can’t catch everything, AI can assist human reviewers by:
1)
Suggesting ways to make the code more readable.
2)
Highlighting things that are often missed, like unclear logic or missing documentation.
3)
Making sure reviews are consistent and follow best practices.
Example: Imagine a developer who always forgets to add comments in the code. If the AI keeps pointing it out, they’ll start paying more attention to it.
ACTIONS TAKN BY THE USER
1)
Use AI to analyze code reviews.
2)
developers will create new tools for missing review metrics.
3)
developers will use the AI to optimize the code , which will reduce the overall costs.
