# Code Review Analytics  

## What I Understood from the Problem  
Code reviews help keep software clean and efficient. However, humans review code differently—some focus on readability, others on security, and some rush through without much attention. This inconsistency can lead to issues.  

### Example  
A startup company needs to submit a solution before a deadline. Developer **Ram** submits the solution for review, while another developer **Shyam** does not optimize the code and quickly submits it without proper checks. As a result, many bugs are later found in the code, causing delays and frustration.  

Here, we could use an **AI tool** that tracks code quality, highlights rushed approvals, and provides detailed feedback to avoid such issues.  

## Who Will Use These Tools?  
1. **Developers** – To understand how good their code quality is.  
2. **Managers** – To track how well reviews are being conducted.  
3. **Testers** – To ensure that the reviewed code meets quality standards before release.  

## How Will They Use It?  
1. A tool that checks:  
   - Code quality, readability  
   - How long the review takes for one code  
2. An **AI-powered review tool** that provides:  
   - Feedback on the code  
   - Code optimization suggestions  

## What Benefits Do Users Get?  
1. **Optimized Resource Utilization** – By ensuring proper code reviews, teams spend less time fixing mistakes and can focus on new features.  
2. **Developers** – Receive AI feedback to improve their review and coding skills.  
3. **Managers** – Can set benchmarks for review quality.  
4. **Customer Satisfaction** – Higher code quality results in fewer bugs and a better user experience.  
5. **Cost Reduction** – A well-reviewed code that works the first time reduces rework, saving time and development costs.  

### Example  
If a developer never checks documentation but AI always highlights it, they will start paying more attention and improve their review habits.  

## How Do We Check Code Quality?  
There are two main ways to check if code is good:  

1. **Using Automated Tools & Tests** – 
***License Compliance*** – Every open-source tool/library has a license.  
  An automated tool will scan the project and check if all licenses are compatible with our company's policies.
These tools scan the code and provide feedback without human review. They check for:  
   - **Efficiency** – Does the code run fast and use resources wisely?  
   - **Bug-Free** – Are there errors or security issues that need fixing?  

2. **Human Code Reviews** – Some aspects require manual review. AI can assist by pointing out potential improvements. Human reviewers focus on:  
   - **Readability** – Is the code clear and easy to understand?  
   - **Maintainability** – Will it be easy to update or modify in the future?  

## How AI Can Help with Code Reviews  
Since automated tools can’t catch everything, **AI can assist human reviewers** by:  
1. Suggesting ways to improve code readability.  
2. Highlighting often-missed issues, such as unclear logic or missing documentation.  
3. Ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.  

### Example  
A developer who forgets to add comments in the code will start paying more attention if AI consistently flags it.  

## Actions Taken by Users  
1. Use AI to analyze code reviews.  
2. Developers will create new tools for missing review metrics.  
3. Developers will use AI to optimize code, reducing overall costs.
